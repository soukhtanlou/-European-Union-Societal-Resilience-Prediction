## Overview
In the face of increasing crises and uncertainties, the capacity of European societies to maintain societal resilience is of critical importance. This study aims to utilize machine learning techniques to predict the Societal Resilience indicator, examining the interplay of demographic and attitudinal factors. 

## Research Question
The primary research question of this study is to utilize machine learning techniques to predict the Societal Resilience indicator, examining the interplay of demographic and attitudinal factors.

## Background
Drawing upon the profound societal impacts of recent challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic, migration pressures, and economic instability, this research constructs a societal resilience indicator based on emotional attachment to Europe, trust in parliamentary institutions, and perceptions of trustworthiness within people.

## Data and Methodology
Leveraging data science and machine learning techniques, the study aims to predict the Societal Resilience indicator using data from the European Social Surveys Wave 10. The research design encompasses a multifaceted analysis, involving data selection based on theoretical reviews, feature engineering to construct the target and encode variables, and comparison of the performance of various predictive models.

## Results
The models achieved F1 scores of LightGBM 0.781, Logistic Regression 0.773, Neural Network (MLP) 0.769, and Random Forest 0.769, which significantly surpassed the baseline Decision Tree model with an F1 of 0.689. Sociological findings reveal that demographic factors have a minimal impact on societal resilience prediction, while trust in political institutions plays a substantial role in assessing resilience levels.

## Conclusion
In light of the growing prevalence of societal challenges, this research makes a timely and significant contribution to the understanding of societal resilience. Compared to other studies, this research contributes novel perspectives to machine learning paradigms for predicting societal resilience and illuminating the intricate social dynamics of European societies in an up-to-date dataset. The findings provide valuable insights for policymakers and civil society organizations seeking to enhance societal resilience in Europe.
